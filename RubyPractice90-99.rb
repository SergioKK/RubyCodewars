Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of a sequence of integers.
The sequence is defined by 3 non-negative values: begin, end, step.
If begin value is greater than the end, your function should return 0. 
If end is not the result of an integer number of steps, then don't add it to the sum.

There are pillars near the road. 
The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. 
Your function accepts three arguments:

number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).

Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).
=end

  # elsif num_of_pillars == 2
  #   result = distance*100
